Step-Step:
apt install snmp-mibs-downloader
Enabling MIB files
On RedHat-based systems the mib files should be enabled by default. On Debian-based systems you have to edit file /etc/snmp/snmp.conf and comment out the line that says mibs :

# As the snmp packages come without MIB files due to license reasons, loading
# of MIBs is disabled by default. If you added the MIBs you can reenable
# loading them by commenting out the following line.
#mibs :

Testing MIB files
Testing snmp MIBs can be done using snmpwalk utility. If you don't have it installed, use the following instructions.

On Debian-based systems:

# apt install snmp

snmpwalk -v 2c -c public <NETWORK DEVICE IP> ifInOctets
Used options:
-v 2c	use SNMP protocol version 2c
-c public	specify SNMP community - “public”

snmptranslate -m CPQHLTH-MIB -Tz | egrep '"1\.3\.6\.1\.4\.1\.[0-9]+"'
